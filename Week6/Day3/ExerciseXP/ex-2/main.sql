-- üåü Exercise 2 : DVD Rental
-- Instructions
-- Use UPDATE to change the language of some films. Make sure that you use valid languages.
-- Which foreign keys (references) are defined for the customer table? How does this affect the way in which we INSERT into the customer table?
-- We created a new table called customer_review. Drop this table. Is this an easy step, or does it need extra checking?
-- Find out how many rentals are still outstanding (ie. have not been returned to the store yet).
-- Find the 30 most expensive movies which are outstanding (ie. have not been returned to the store yet)
-- Your friend is at the store, and decides to rent a movie. He knows he wants to see 4 movies, but he can‚Äôt remember their names. Can you help him find which movies he wants to rent?
-- The 1st film : The film is about a sumo wrestler, and one of the actors is Penelope Monroe.
-- The 2nd film : A short documentary (less than 1 hour long), rated ‚ÄúR‚Äù.
-- The 3rd film : A film that his friend Matthew Mahan rented. He paid over $4.00 for the rental, and he returned it between the 28th of July and the 1st of August, 2005.
-- The 4th film : His friend Matthew Mahan watched this film, as well. It had the word ‚Äúboat‚Äù in the title or description, and it looked like it was a very expensive DVD to replace.
